# Weather Notification System

This Python script uses the OpenWeatherMap API to check weather forecasts for a specific location and sends SMS notifications via Twilio if rain is predicted for that area.

## Project Overview

The script performs the following tasks:

1. Fetches weather forecast data for a given location using the OpenWeatherMap API.
2. Checks the weather conditions for the next few hours and determines if rain is forecasted based on weather condition codes.
3. If rain is expected, it sends an SMS notification using the Twilio API to remind the user to bring an umbrella.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install requests twilio
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables:
   - Set the `OWM_API_KEY` environment variable with your OpenWeatherMap API key.
   - Set the `AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable with your Twilio authentication token.
   - Ensure you have a Twilio account SID and Twilio virtual/real phone numbers ready for use.

4. Update the script `weather_notification.py`:
   - Modify the latitude and longitude values in the `weather_params` dictionary to your desired location.
   - Replace the placeholder values in the Twilio API configuration (Twilio virtual number and verified real number) with your actual Twilio phone numbers.

5. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python weather_notification.py
   ```

## Dependencies
